# Losses

Have you ever lost to a merciless machine? It doesn't care how close you are to death or how hard you are trying to win. It simply does what it was programmed to do with no consideration of you.

2. You will die
3. Dont die

I don't seem to be able to add alt text without breaking this CMS.

Congratulations you made it to the end of this blog post!
